# Remote Robot Competition 2020
This is code for the remote robot competition, Vassar College, Spring 2020.

Task: Getting a robot to finish a maze in the shortest amount of time possible. 

Readme files in each Milestone folder summarize setup and programming procedures; most of the code is based off of professor Josh de Leeuw's tutorials at https://github.com/jodeleeuw/robot_competition_2020 and .ino files are located in each folder as well. Milestone completion videos are linked in the readme files which will redirect to a Google drive video. My deepest apologies for the motion-sickness-inducing camera work oof
