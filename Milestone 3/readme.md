# Milestone 3
> Get the Zumo to follow a line along 2' x 2' square. (Create a square using the tape, 2ft on each side. Place the Zumo anywhere on the square and get it to follow the square for at least a full lap.)

## Comments
- There were some dark splotches on my floor that were confusing the robot, that's why there are pieces of paper on the edges.
- increased base speed and adjusted proportion gain from example code
- Pretty much same as milestone 2
