# Milestone 6
> Get the Zumo to solve a maze with branching and then repeat the maze and follow a memorized path.

## Comments
- I added the example functions ```path_reduce``` and ```run_solved_maze``` from the tutorial to my code and switched up some speed and threshold values. 
- To cut down on time, I sped up the calibration process by increasing the motor speeds and decreasing delays. I will play around with the base speed some more for milestone 7; when I kept it at 350 as I have been for the other milestones the robot kept losing track of itself for some reason?
