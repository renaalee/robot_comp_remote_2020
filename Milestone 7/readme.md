# Milestone 7
> Have a final run in the practice maze of under 15 seconds. This is a bit faster than my solutions go, so you'll need to improve upon them by upping the speed and calibrating.

## Comments
- As mentioned, I was having trouble with navigation when the base speed was too high so I settled for 310. I also tweaked the calibration some, because on turns it was overrotating a bit. This is the fastest I could get the robot to complete the maze, which was 10.7 seconds. This is my submission for the robot competition.
